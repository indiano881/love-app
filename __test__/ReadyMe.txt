Love App is a simple compatibility generator that takes 2 inputs (only strings or symbol/NO null or numbers) 
and generate a compatibility number from 0 to 100.

The optimal App workflow should be like this:

When you land on the page you will see the 2 input fields and CALCULATE COMPATIBILITY (CC) button button and below a START button.
2Combinations sample will be visible.

1)Until the button START is not clicked the infut fileds and the CC button are DISABLED but anyway visible to user.

2)Once START is clicked: 
    => the button text mewssage will swap to STOP AND CLEAR
    => inupt fields and button are ENABLED
    => 2 combinations samples will disappear

3)since START as been pressed, users can type in the input two strings and press CC button.
when CC button is clicked:
    => under CC button you will see a message "Compatibility score is: {numer}"
    => in the component below you will see the list updated with a message like "name 1+ name 2 = number"

OBS. user should not be allowed to type numbers or null even in combination with single strings. In this case even if users 
clicks CC button nothing will appear or disappear.

4)When user is tired, can click the STOP AND CLEAR button.
Once STOP AND CLEAR button is clicked: 
    =>button text back to START
    =>all combinations will disappear.
    =>no samples visible.

In the folder screenshots.workflow you will find the images of workflow. The numbers are in the correct order and should follow the description above.
